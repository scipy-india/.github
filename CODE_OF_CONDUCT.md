# SciPy India Code of Conduct

SciPy India is a multidisciplinary community and forum for users and developers of the SciPy stack in India. Our community is built on the principles of collaboration, inclusivity, and respect for all participants. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, regardless of background, identity, or experience. We expect that all participants treat each other with respect and kindness.

The SciPy India community is governed by the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct). This document outlines our expectations for participants within the community and provides a mechanism for reporting unacceptable behaviour and addressing grievances that may arise.

Everyone is expected to follow the Code of Conduct in all community spaces, including online or physical fora (GitHub, Zulip, and more), meetups, events, workshops, conferences, and any other in-person interactions between members at SciPy India gatherings.

## Reporting

If you would like to report a violation, please do so by contacting the SciPy India team or through our [anonymous reporting form](TODO: link to reporting form here) . Please do not hesitate to report any behaviour that you believe violates the Code of Conduct, even if you are unsure whether it constitutes one.

## Enforcement

A dedicated team will review all reports and take appropriate action as per the NumFOCUS Code of Condut. This may include warnings, temporary or permanent bans from community spaces, or other measures deemed necessary to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all participants.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the Code of Conduct, please reach out to the community on [Zulip](https://scipyindia.zulipchat.com) or via email at[mailto:TODO]
